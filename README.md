##About
A clone of the infamous GMod gamemode; one team plays as hunters whilst the other has to disguise and blend in with objects around the map.

Prop players are given a small amount of time to move away from the hunters, choose their prop and hide; afterwards the hunter team moves out and attempts to find and kill the prop players. At the end of each round the new round teams are randomized with roughly half hunters and half props, anyone joining or dead can spectate the map with a flying camera view.

Prop controls: WASD Space, E (Change prop), R (Rotate), Q (Zero velocity)

Hunter controls: WASD Space, R (Reload), Mouse1 (Fire)
